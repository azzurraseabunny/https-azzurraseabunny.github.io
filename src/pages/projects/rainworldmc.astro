          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            Rainworld MC is a Minecraft Adventure/Survival map recreation project based on the hit game *Rainworld*, led by PiggyKropotkin. The project encapsulates and mimics the gameplay of the entire *Rainworld* map in a 3D space, which is carefully planned and requires high skill and creativity to implement a 2D map into a 3D environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also implements the core movement mechanics, world mechanics, and creatures from *Rainworld*, along with some creative adaptations of scenarios from *Rainworld* that would make sense in a 3D setting. This is a non-profit project, and everyone is working on it out of pure passion.

          <h2>Project's History</h2>
          <p>
            The project began in 2023 when PiggyKropotkin released a video of his recreation of a Rainworld region in Minecraft, the Underhang. It quickly gained attention and traction, attracting many talented people to join the project. This led to the kickstarting of the entire map's recreation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project's success didn't go unnoticed. It caught the attention of the head developer of a Rainworld DLC, as well as other well-known developers and modders within the community. Over the course of two years, the project has recruited over 100 contributors, some of whom are responsible for art, music, modeling, coding, and building the map, along with several developers, further enhancing its progress.

          <h2>The Map</h2>
          <p>
            The map is the main selling point of the entire project, with it being a couple thousand blocks wide, filled with content on all nooks and crannies, aswell as having the entire height limit raised up to another thousand blocks in both up and down to house the centerpiece of the map, Five Pebbles' Superstructure. that plus with a couple bonus regions and areas that were expanded upon to make it feel more open world, to make you feel small in comparison. the map comprises of hundreds of custom modeled blocks as well as a shader system that recolors the map's assets to fit the color scheme of each region. it also has gameplay features to make the map more faithful to the original game, such as pipes, poles, tunnels and customized mod that mimics the movement of the main game

          <h2>The Creatures</h2>
          <p>
            The creatures are a key part of Rainworld's identity, with AI that mimics real predatory wildlife in an ecosystem. Iâ€™m fortunate to be the one who is responsible for modelling most of RainworldMC's flora and fauna. They will complement the map by providing challenging, unpredictable gameplay that enhances the Rainworld MC experience.<br><br>You can view the best models i made for the project here!
